# Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You are working on -
or planning to work on - 
a large-scale `JavaScript` project
and don't want the pain of 
`"Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"` ... üò¢

# Who? üë•

Any software engineer
with (or without) 
`JavaScript` skills
who wants a better experience.


# What? üí≠

`TypeScript` is a 
[superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset)
of `JavaScript`: 

<img src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-typescript/assets/194400/f66be0cf-6689-4998-a312-fe83031c76bc" 
    width="300" alt="TypeScript superset of JavaScript">

This means it _includes_ all the 
[features](https://github.com/dwyl/Javascript-the-Good-Parts-notes)
we know and love/hate
from `JavaScript`
and has many _additional_ 
features, `types` and tooling
to make our lives easier.

`JavaScript` is 
[**_dynamically_ typed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
which means
variables can be assigned _any_ value 
by the interpreter at runtime 
based on the variable's value at the time.

This is great if you need flexibility while building something _fast_,
but it becomes a problem later when your function needs to _know_ 
what type of variable it is going to receive. 

## Quick _Example_! 1Ô∏è‚É£ + 2Ô∏è‚É£

The advantage of **_static_ types** 
is best illustrated by a _quick example_,
a simple addition function in `JavaScript`:

```js
function add (x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

If we invoke the `add` function with two numbers:

```js
add(1, 2)
> 3
```

So far so good.
And if we accidentally `add` a `number` to a `string`:

```js
add(1, "hello")
> '1hello'
```

It still works because `JavaScript` has type-coerced the `1` to a `string`
and returned a `string`, in this case `'1hello'` as the result! 

What if somehow a 
[`NaN`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN)
value gets passed into the function?

```js
add(1, NaN)
> NaN
```

Well now the `NaN` cascades through the rest of your Application without being caught!
If you're building an interface for anything in ***Finance***,
the _last_ thing you want is a `NaN` value sneaking in
as the result of a simple calculation. 

We could add a bunch of "checking" code 
to our simple `add` function 
to "guard" against non-numeric values:

```js
function add (x, y) {
  if(isNaN(x) || isNaN(y)) {
    throw new Error(`Arguments to add function ${x} or ${y} are non-numeric!`);
  }
  return x + y;
}
```
Adding this kind of code _works_,
but it has to be **_unit_ tested**.

> **Note**: If you're totally new to **Test-Driven Development**,
consider trying our
[`learn-tdd`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)
tutorial. 

Even a basic function like `add`
ends up being a _lot_ more lines
of code and tests ...

`TypeScript` prevents this and 
_many_ other bugs from entering your codebase
by simply _typing_ the arguments for the function!

```ts
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
```

Here we have clearly defined the `type` 
of the arguments to be `number` 
and the `return` is also a `number`.
If we attempt to invoke the `add` function
with a `string` (or any other non-numeric value):

```ts
add(1, "hello")
```

the `TypeScript` compiler will 
throw a _compile_ time error:

```ts
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

Try it for yourself on
the `TypeScript` _playground_:
